## NiceCalculator

NiceCalculator is a simple calculator application built in Scala. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more complex calculations like computing the square of an expression.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run NiceCalculator, you must have Scala installed on your machine.

### Installing

Clone the NiceCalculator repository:

Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

arduino

$ sbt run

This will start the application in the console.

## Using the Calculator


Once the application is running, you can perform basic arithmetic operations by entering expressions in the following format:


For example, to add two numbers, enter:

2 + 3

To compute the square of an expression, enter:


square [operand] [operator] [operand]

For example, to compute the square of the expression (2 + 3) * 4, enter:


square (2 + 3) * 4
